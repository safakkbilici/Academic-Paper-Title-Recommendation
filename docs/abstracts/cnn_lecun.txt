Multilayer Neural Networks trained with the backpropagation algorithm constitute the best example of a successful Gradient-Based Learning 
technique. Given an appropriate network architecture, Gradient-Based Learning algorithms can be used to synthesize a complex decision surface that can 
classify high-dimensional patterns such as handwritten characters, 
with minimal preprocessing. This paper reviews various methods applied to handwritten character recognition
and compares them on a standard handwritten digit recognition task. Convolutional Neural Networks, that are specifically 
designed to deal with the variability of 2D shapes, are
shown to outperform all other techniques.
Real-life document recognition systems are composed
of multiple modules including eld extraction, segmentation, recognition, and language modeling. A new learning
paradigm, called Graph Transformer Networks (GTN), allows such multi-module systems to be trained globally using
Gradient-Based methods so as to minimize an overall per-
formance measure. Two systems for on-line handwriting recognition are described. Experiments demonstrate the advantage of global
training, and the 	exibility of Graph Transformer Networks.
A Graph Transformer Network for reading bank check is
also described. It uses Convolutional Neural Network character recognizers combined with global training techniques 
to provides record accuracy on business and personal checks.
It is deployed commercially and reads several million checks
per day
