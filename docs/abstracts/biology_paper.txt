A new method is presented to detect bimodality in gene expression data using the Gaussian Mixture Models to cluster samples in each mode. We have used the method to search for bimodal genes in data from 25 tumor types available from The Cancer Genome Atlas. The method identified 554 genes with bimodal gene expression, of which 46 were identified in more than one cancer type. To further illustrate the impact of the method, we show that 96 out of the 554 genes with bimodal expression patterns presented different prognosis when patients belonging to the two expression peaks are compared.
