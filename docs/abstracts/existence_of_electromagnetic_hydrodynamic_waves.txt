IF a conducting liquid is placed in a constant magnetic field, every motion of the liquid gives rise to an E. M. F. which produces electric currents. Owing to the magnetic field, these currents give mechanical forces which change the state of motion of the liquid. Thus a kind of combined electromagnetic-hydro-dynamic wave is produced which, so far as I know, has as yet attracted no attention.
